## ✨ Features Implemented

BringIt covers the entire lifecycle of an on-demand service, from user authentication to real-time tracking.

* **Secure Authentication:** Multi-factor authentication support (Email & Phone verification).
* **Real-Time Tracking:** Users can track the delivery vehicle on the map using integrated location services.
* **Persistent Data Management:** Full **CRUD** functionality for managing user profiles, order creation, and status updates.
* **Notification System:** Uses the **Notification Manager** to send timely alerts about order changes and driver arrival.
* **Complex Navigation Flow:** A deep structure featuring a minimum of **10 distinct activities/fragments/ListViews** to manage the ordering process.
* **Data Display:** Dynamic data presentation using `ListView` components, loading data asynchronously from the API.
